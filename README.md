# Python Basics Lesson
A lesson outline for Girls Who Code - Free Coding Workshop for Kids teaching Python Basics.

### Python History
  * Python is a programming language that can be used to: build websites,  automate tasks, and more!
  * Python was created in 1991 in Holland, by a man named Guido van Rossum.
  *  Python is one of the most popular programming languages today!

### Python Types
There are many different data types that Python uses, but today we will be focusing on integer (number) data types and string (word) data types.
 * Integers are whole numbers, so no decimals or fractions.
 * Strings are words, letters, and characters. When using strings, you must have quotation marks ("") around your string, like how you must use quotation marks when
   you are writing to show what someone has said!

Examples of Integers:
```python
5
17
100
12358660964382304
```

Examples of Strings:
```python
"Hello!"
"This is a string."
"coding"
```

### Python Print


### Python Variables
  * variables are containers that can store values for later use
  * to set a variable, you type in the name of your new variable, an equal sign, and whatever you want your variable to represent <br>

  
Examples of Setting Variables:
```python 
x = 5
name = "Sally"
```
