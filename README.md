# Python Coding Workshop Resources
This repository serves as the hub for the content of the free coding workshops for local, underserved kids sponsored New Horizon's Governor's School for Science and Technology's Girls Who Code club and Octo, an IBM company. These coding workshops are meant to foster a fun and interactive environment for STEM engagement - an effort to increase diversity in the STEM sphere. Free coding books are given out to participants as part of a $1000 sponsorship coordinated with Octo to encourage learning beyond our classrooms. 

## Lesson Outline
